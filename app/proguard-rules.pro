# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Crashlytics: keep file names and line numbers so deobfuscated release stack traces point at the
# right line, and keep custom exception class names readable in crash reports.
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
-keep public class * extends java.lang.Exception
# Room (used internally by WorkManager) creates its generated *_Impl database classes by
# reflection through the no-arg constructor. Without this rule R8 strips that constructor and the
# app crashes at startup with NoSuchMethodException: WorkDatabase_Impl.<init>.
-keep class * extends androidx.room.RoomDatabase {
    <init>();
}
